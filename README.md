# Implementing user authentication with Azure Active Directory B2C
This repo implements a React Single Page Application to demonstrate end user sign-in, sign-out and Edit Profile functionalities offered by the [AD B2C](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/services/active-directory/external-identities/b2c/#features). It uses Microsoft Authentication Library  for React ([msal-react](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/tree/dev/lib/msal-react)) to enable user authentication using Azure Active Directory B2C.


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).



## Getting Started 

You can get an overview of Azure AD B2C [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/services/active-directory/external-identities/b2c/).

### Install dependencies

In the project directory, you can run `yarn install` to install the dependencies from package.json.

If you are using npm, you can run `npm install`

Note that the MSAL React library used in this app is a preview version.

### Configure AD B2C
Essentially, you ned to create an AD B2C tenant, create app registration, create user flows for sign-in, sign-up and edit profiles and configure the tenant appropriately. You can follow the instructions in my [blog post](https://www.iotality.com/azure-adb2c-create-app-user-flows/). 

_Make sure that the implicit flow is turned off by deselecting both Access tokens and ID tokens in the authentication section of app registrations. The implicit flow is not a secure one and it was used in the blog post only for a quick demonsrtation and testing of the AD B2C tenant configuration._

For more details, you can go through [Microsoft documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-b2c/tutorial-create-tenant)

### Configure the app
Create a file named `.env` in the root folder of the project. Add following entries in the file. Make sure all the strings are enclosed in double quotes.

```
ADB2C_CLIENT_ID="{YOUR_ADB2C_APP_TENANT_ID}"
ADB2C_AUTHORITY="https://{YOUR_TENANT_NAME}.b2clogin.com/{YOUR_TENANT_NAME}.onmicrosoft.com/{YOUR_SIGN_IN_SIGN_UP_POLICY}"
ADB2C_KNOWN_AUTHORITIES="{YOUR_TENANT_NAME}.b2clogin.com,"
REACT_APP_ADB2C_LOGIN_SCOPES="{ANY_SCOPE_YOU_WANT_TO_USE}"

REACT_APP_ADB2C_REDIRECT_URI="{YOUR_ADB2C_APP_REDIRECT_URI}"
REACT_APP_ADB2C_POST_LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URI="{YOUR_ADB2C_APP_POST_LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URI}"

ADB2C_SIGNUP_SIGNIN_POLICY="{YOUR_SIGN_IN_SIGN_UP_POLICY}"
```

If you are in doubt, here is a sample .env file.

```
REACT_APP_ADB2C_CLIENT_ID="abcdef12-e3f9-43h0-0ad9-7b0g5h8rsm28"
REACT_APP_ADB2C_AUTHORITY="https://mytenant.b2clogin.com/mytenant.onmicrosoft.com/B2C_1_susi"
REACT_APP_ADB2C_KNOWN_AUTHORITIES="mytenant.b2clogin.com,"
REACT_APP_ADB2C_LOGIN_SCOPES=","

REACT_APP_ADB2C_REDIRECT_URI="http://localhost:3006"
REACT_APP_ADB2C_POST_LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URI="http://localhost:3006"

REACT_APP_ADB2C_SIGNUP_SIGNIN_POLICY="B2C_1_susi"
```


### Run the app

In the project directory, run `yarn start`.

If you are using npm, you can run `npm start`.

This will run the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

If everything is configured correctly, you should get the demo app running in your browser. When you click on the **LOGIN** button, you should see an option to sign-up as well. (Enable browser pop-ups as the code pops up a login window). You can try yourself signing up with an email address. AD B2C has in-built 2 factor authentication to verify your email address before letting you sign-up. Once logged in, you can view your profile in the main page of the app. Click on **EDIT PROFILE** button to edit your profile. Finally, you can sign out with the **LOGOUT** button.
